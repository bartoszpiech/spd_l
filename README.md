# SPD - laboratories
Programs written as homework for Control of discrete processes (SPD) on Wroclaw
University of Science and Technology. The code is split into separate
laboratories.

## Algorithms
We worked on(split on what we worked during laboratories):
- RPQ problem (1|r_j|C_max):
	- Sorting based on preparation time,
- RPQ problem (1|r_i, q_i|C_max):
	- Schrage algorithm,
	- Schrage algorithm using priority queue,
	- Schrage algorithm with interrupts,
- Permutation Flow shop problem (FP||C_max):
	- Johnson's algorithm,
	- Branch and Bounds algorithm,
	- Bruteforce,
- Total Weighted Tardiness problem (1||âˆ‘w_iT_i):
	- Bruteforce,
	- Dynamic programming (not working properly),
- Permutation Flow shop problem:
	- NEH algorithm (not working properly),
- Permutation Flow shop problem(FP||C_max):
	- Simulated annealing algorithm.
